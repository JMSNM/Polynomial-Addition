# Polynomial Addition

## Description
This C++ program reads polynomials from a file, adds them, and outputs the result. It also provides options to display the contents of the file and calculates some statistics about the data.

## How to Use
1. Compile the code using a C++ compiler.
2. Run the compiled executable.
3. Input the name of the file containing the polynomials.
4. Choose whether to display the contents of the file or not.
5. The program will compute the sum of the polynomials and display the result.
6. It will also create a file named "result_addition.txt" containing the filename and the result of the addition.

## Input File Format
The input file should contain the following:
- The first line should contain the number of polynomials.
- The second line should contain the number of variables per polynomial.
- The subsequent lines should contain the coefficients of each variable for each polynomial.

## Output
The program will output:
- The result of polynomial addition.
- Statistics about the data, including the filename, the number of polynomials, the number of variables, and the number of non-zero values.
- The time taken to execute the addition process.
